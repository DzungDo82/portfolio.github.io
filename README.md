## Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Big Data projects
In this section, I will outline the processes for implementing machine learning, deep learning, and Big Data projects based on my experience with each project.

### Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom
**- Link:** [`Telecom_Churn`](https://github.com/DzungDo82/TeleChurn)    
**- Description:** Developed and implemented predictive analytics models for customer churn, with a focus on identifying and prioritizing potential defectors for targeted customer retention efforts.  
**- Skills:** Loading the data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): data visualization - correlation heatmap, correlating categorical features, and correlating numerical features, Feature engineering, Model training - Spliting (train and test dataset), evaluating important levels of features for each model, grid search, scaling, baseline model comparison,  pipeline, sampling, and combining sacler, sampler and model.<br>
**- Technology:** Python - Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn preprocessing, metrics, and models (Imbalanced-learn, F1 score, accuracy score, confusion matrix, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNeighbors, XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)<br>
**- Results:** Selected 75% of relevant features for model training and achieved a 96% predictive accuracy with the Random Forest Classifier.

### Click-Through Rate (CTR) project
**- Link:** [`Click-Through Rate project`](https://github.com/DzungDo82/Click-Through-Rate/blob/main/CTR_presentation.pdf)
**- Description:** Measured the click-through rate by comparing the number of clicks on an ad within the payment app to the number of impressions it received.<br>
**- Skills:** Designed table schemas, assembled a modeling dataset of over 2 million rows, connected two tools, loaded data, conducted feature engineering, binning, visualization, data cleaning, and model training.<br>
**- Technology:** SQL, Python - SQL Alchemy, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn preprocessing, metrics, and models (Imbalanced-learn, F1 score, accuracy score, confusion matrix, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNeighbors, XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)<br>
**- Results:** Skilled in handling imbalanced datasets (92% vs. 8%) and discovered the optimal combination of Standard Scaler + SMOTE + Random Forest Classifier, achieving a predictive accuracy score of 73%.
