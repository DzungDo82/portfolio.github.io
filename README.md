## Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Big Data projects
In this section, I will outline the processes for implementing machine learning, deep learning, and Big Data projects based on my experience with each project.

### Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom
**- Link:** [`Telecom_Churn`](https://github.com/DzungDo82/TeleChurn)    
**- Description:** Developed and implemented predictive analytics models for customer churn, with a focus on identifying and prioritizing potential defectors for targeted customer retention efforts.  
**- Skills:** Loading the data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): data visualization - correlation heatmap, correlating categorical features, and correlating numerical features, Feature engineering, Model training - Spliting (train and test dataset), evaluating important levels of features for each model, grid search, scaling, baseline model comparison,  pipeline, sampling, and combining sacler, sampler and model.<br>
**- Technology:** Python - Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn preprocessing, metrics, and models (Imbalanced-learn, F1 score, accuracy score, confusion matrix, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNeighbors, XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)<br>
**- Results:** Selected 75% of relevant features for model training and achieved a 96% predictive accuracy with the Random Forest Classifier.

### Click-Through Rate (CTR) project
**- Link:** [`Click-Through Rate`](https://github.com/DzungDo82/Click-Through-Rate)
**- Description:** Measured the click-through rate by comparing the number of clicks on an ad within the payment app to the number of impressions it received.<br>
**- Skills:** Designed table schemas, assembled a modeling dataset of over 2 million rows, connected two tools, loaded data, conducted feature engineering, binning, visualization, data cleaning, and model training.<br>
**- Technology:** SQL, Python - SQL Alchemy, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn preprocessing, metrics, and models (Imbalanced-learn, F1 score, accuracy score, confusion matrix, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNeighbors, XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)<br>
**- Results:** Skilled in handling imbalanced datasets (92% vs. 8%) and discovered the optimal combination of Standard Scaler + SMOTE + Random Forest Classifier, achieving a predictive accuracy score of 73%.

### Profit Forecasting of the online store
**- Link:** [`Profit Forecasting`](https://github.com/DzungDo82/Profit_Forecasting) <br>
**- Description:** Aimed to employ time series forecasting techniques to predict sales and profit, leveraging the patterns and characteristics extracted from the time series analysis of the superstore's historical data.<br>
**- Skills:** Studied forecasting methods and subsequently analyzed the concepts, pros, and cons of time series models.<br>
**- Technology:** Python - applied ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models to predict the profit for the next year.<br>
**- Results:** Studied a new concept - forecasting methods, and subsequently analyzed the concepts, pros vs. cons of time series, successfully applying new models from start to finish the project within 2 weeks.

### E-Commerce sales (Customer-Centric Business Intelligence)
**- Link:** [`Customer metrics - RFM`](https://github.com/DzungDo82/Ecommerce_RFM) <br>
**- Description:** Leveraged the E-Commerce dataset, conducted customer segmentation to optimize marketing strategies and uncover insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product popularity for the business specializing in unique products.<br>
**- Skills:** Applied the RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary factors) model, identifying three to five crucial client groups, and then advanced to predict customer loyalty levels using Deep Learning methods.<br>
**- Technology:** Utilized KMeans Clustering to RFM results for Silhouette score and used scikit-learn and TensorFlow for deep learning.<br>
**- Results:** Successfully aligned business objectives with quantifiable metrics, resulting in more effective and targeted marketing strategies when implementing the RFM model, which evaluates customer behavior, and 100% achieved predicted loyal customer levels – high vs. low with a new dataset.

### Twitter Sentiment Analysis
**- Link:** [`Twitter Sentiment Analysis`](https://github.com/DzungDo82/Twitter_BigData) <br>
**- Description:** Selected the topic 'Black Friday' and analyzed user sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) along with exploring the relationship between followers and tweets for the top 10 users..<br>
**- Skills:** Trained sentiment classification, read tweets from S3, generated predictions, and integrated them into the Quicksight dashboard for analysis.<br>
**- Technology:** EC2, S3, Athena, and Quicksight on AWS, and Spark on Databricks<br>
**- Results:** Managed the big data project and integraged multiple tools.
