## Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Big Data projects
In this section, I will outline the processes for implementing machine learning, deep learning, and Big Data projects based on my experience with each project.

### Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom
**- Link:** [`Telecom_Churn`](https://github.com/DzungDo82/TeleChurn)    
**- Description:** Developed and implemented predictive analytics models for customer churn, with a focus on identifying and prioritizing potential defectors for targeted customer retention efforts.  
**- Skills:** Loading the data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): data visualization - correlation heatmap, correlating categorical features, and correlating numerical features, Feature engineering, Model training - Spliting (train and test dataset), evaluating important levels of features for each model, grid search, scaling, baseline model comparison,  pipeline, sampling, and combining sacler, sampler and model.<br>
**- Technology:** Python - Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn preprocessing, metrics, and models (Imbalanced-learn, F1 score, accuracy score, confusion matrix, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNeighbors, XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)<br>
**- Results:** Selected 75% of relevant features for model training and achieved a 96% predictive accuracy with the Random Forest Classifier.

### Click-Through Rate (CTR) project
**- Link:** [`Telecom_Churn`](https://github.com/DzungDo82/TeleChurn)    
**- Description:** Measured the click-through rate by comparing the number of clicks on an ad within the payment app to the number of impressions it received.  
**- Skills:** Utilized SQL Alchemy for connection and table loading from SQL, performed feature engineering, binning, visualization, data cleaning, and conducted model training, incorporating techniques such as holdout cross-validation, baseline model establishment, pipeline, grid search, K-fold validation, metrics (scaling (StandardScaler, RobustScaler, MinMaxScaler, OneHotEncoder), sampling (SMOTE, RandomUnderSampler, and RandomOverSampler), and implementing classifier models.<br>
**- Technology:** Python - SQL Alchemy, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn preprocessing, metrics (recall_score, f1_score, precision_score, roc_curve, roc_auc_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score), and models (Imbalanced-learn, F1 score, accuracy score, confusion matrix, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNeighbors, XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)<br>
**- Results:** Designed table schemas and assembled a modeling dataset with more than 2.4 million rows and 24 columns, filled missing values, addressed the imbalanced dataset (92% vs. 8%), and selected the best model combination - StandardScaler + SMOTE + RandomForestClassifier, achieving a 73% accuracy score.
